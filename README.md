<h1>Marvel Heroes and Villians Database</h1>


I have been a fan of the Marvel Movies and comics for a long time and find when watching the movies I always do a bit of research on characters and the movies. 
I love to research the first comics that a hero appeared in and what the best issues are to read. I thought I would start by putting that into my database. 


This webiste is designed for the new fans of the Marvel Cinematic universe and the comics. It's design is to show a list of all the characters with the basic facts about the characters and movies that they appear in. 

The big feature is that users are able to add their own superheroes to the website incase some have been missed, and obviously users have different knowledge levels and know things that other dont. 

I have used a mixtrue of python and javascript. Although the Javascript is mostly used for subtle details in the website, Like the mobile links where the navbar shortens to a burger menu for mobile devices. 

For testing I used my website on both on the python.app preview and heroku. I signed up to the webiste using many users, and tested it by signing in an out. This gave me a better view on how the website is working once deployed, I noticed that the profile wasn't staying logged in as well as issues with the flash messages not showing up in the correct places.

I used materialize css for the css and design of the website. I have not used this before, I found it okay to use but would prefer to use bootstrap in the future, as I found it a better designer, giving cleaner templates and features but it was good to see how a different css provider works. 


 
Deployment
I have used Heroku to deploy this app. I've never used heroku before, deciding to use github pages in previous projects. The deployment to heroku was simple and easy and the changes I make to my commit happen pretty soon.
